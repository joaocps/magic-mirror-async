Hello everyone! :wave:

In this repository you will find all the information you need to build your own smart mirror. First of all I want to let you know that this is the cheapest possible implementation, I also leave the prices of most things so you can have some idea when buying your material. In the next sections I present the project a little better and then the focus will be on the crucial parts of the development, whether it is hardware or software.

If you like the work I did and helped you in some way don't forget to click on the button below and pay me a coffee (or a beer, I prefer :smile:).
